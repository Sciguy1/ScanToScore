## Goals
1. Identification steps for image processing based on the following objects/properties
(Step by Step Progression)
 Notes and Clefs:
 a) Identifying the kind of staff being used (Treble, Bass, or Alto Clef to start out with)
 b) Identifying the kind of notes in the staff (A, B, C, D, E, F)
 c) Identifying the kind of note outside the bounds of the staff (lower and upper)
 d) Identifying the accidentials for each note
 e) Identifying the note duration (including ties and dots)
 
 Time Signatures:
 a) Identifying the common time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/4, cut time, etc.)
 b) Identifying the unique time signatures
 
 Measures:
 a)
 b)
 c)
 
 
 Articulations:
 

2. Determining Accuracy of the Image Processing (based on some percentage)

2. Creating A Musescore File using the Data Gathered from OpenCV
